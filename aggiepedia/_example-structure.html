							<p>Texas A&M competes in the following varsity sports:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Baseball</li>
									<li>Basketball</li>
									<li>Football</li>
									<li>Soccer</li>
									<li>Track and field</li>
									<li>More...</li>
								</ul>
							
							<p class="hd2">Baseball</p>
							<p>The Aggie baseball team plays home games at Olsen Field, which went through major renovations and is now Olsen Field at Blue Bell Park. The team is currently coached by Rob Childress, who joined the program in the 2006 season, after leaving his assistant coach position with the Nebraska Cornhuskers. Since conference play began in 1915, the Aggies have won 15 Southwest Conference titles, three Big 12 regular-season and two tournament titles, and have made five College World Series appearances. 1989 was the high-water mark when the Aggies were ranking #1 for numerous weeks before ending the season ranked #2.</p>
							
							<p class="hd2">Basketball</p>
							<p>Texas A&M basketball had been dormant for much of its recent history until the mid-2000s. The Aggies have won 11 conference championships, two conference tournament titles, and have 10 NCAA tournament appearances. Under former head coach Billy Gillispie, the Aggies finished fourth in conference in 2006 only two years removed from having zero wins in conference play. Gillispie then led the Aggies to their first NCAA tournament berth since 1987, playing as a 12 seed, and to A&M's first NCAA tournament win since 1980 over fifth seed Syracuse. The Aggies were one point short of advancing to the Sweet Sixteen over fourth seed LSU, with a final score of 57-58. In the 2007 season, A&M spent most of the season ranked in the top 10 of the polls and became the first Big 12 south team to win against the University of Kansas in Lawrence since the Big 12 was formed. The Aggies finished with a 27-7 record and finished 2nd in the Big 12. They earned a number 3 seed in the NCAA tournament where they made it to the sweet 16, but fell to the University of Memphis 64-65. Acie Law IV was named an All-American. Billy Gillispie left for the University of Kentucky soon after the season. Mark Turgeon was named head coach a few days later, and has amassed a 73-31 record in his first three years in College Station, along with three more NCAA tournament appearances and a 3-3 NCAA tournament record.</p>
							
							Ground broke on the Cox-McFerrin Center in November 2006, a 68,000-square-foot (6,300 m2) expansion to Reed Arena which includes new locker rooms, meeting rooms, practice gyms, training rooms, player lounges, and reception areas.
							
							<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;">Gary Blair</h3>
							<p>The women's basketball team had two NCAA tournament appearances, an NWIT title, and a Southwest Conference tournament title before entering the Big 12. The program experienced little success in the new conference until current head coach Gary Blair took over the program. Blair's teams advanced to the NCAA tournament multiple times. He led the 2011 team to the NCAA national championship.</p>
														
							<p class="hd2">Football</p>
							<p>The Texas A&M Aggies compete in the Southeastern Conference and will enter their 118th year of football competition in the 2012 season. Over the program's history, the Aggies have earned three national titles (1919, 1927, and 1939), 20 conference titles and two Heisman trophies won by John David Crow in 1957 and Johnny Manziel, the first freshman to ever win the award, in 2012.</p>
							
							<p class="hd2">Soccer</p>
							<p>Women's soccer is coached by G. Guerreri, who has led the program since its inception in 1993. His Aggies have won 12 Big 12 titles (7 regular season and 5 tournament), including 4 straight regular season titles from 2004-2007. The Aggies have made 17 consecutive appearances in the NCAA Tournament since 1995. Of those 17, 4 are Elite 8 finishes, and 6 are Sweet 16 finishes. Since 1999, the Aggies have advanced at least as far as the Sweet 16 during all but four of their NCAA Tournament appearances. The Aggies have never been eliminated in the round of 64.</p>
							
							<p class="hd2">Track and Field</p>
							<p>Track and field is coached by Pat Henry. In his 17 years at LSU, Henry won 27 national titles, 17 SEC titles, 15 SEC Coach of the Year awards, and five National Coach of the Year awards. Henry was hired by Texas A&M prior to the 2005 season, taking over a program that had never won a title in women's track. Within three years, in 2007, his teams won both women's indoor and outdoor Big 12 Conference titles. In 2009, 2010, and 2011, he won both the men's and women's NCAA outdoor titles, a feat he has accomplished four times and duplicated by no other coach. Since arriving in College Station, Henry has won two National Coach of the Year and six Big 12 Coach of the Year awards.</p>
